https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/databases/lessons/sql#project-sql-zoo


## Purpose: 
Tutorials 0-9 listed under the “Tutorial Section” of https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial


### Technologies:
* SQL 


### Tools
* Git
* GitHub


### Outcome
* I learned to interpret and perform basic queries on relational databases. 

<br />

## Summary

### What I learned
* **SQL** basics - The three magic words: SELECT, FROM, WHERE
* Although there are lots of keywords used in SQL, SELECT, FROM, and WHERE are the ones you would be using in almost every query that you make. These key words represent the most fundamental aspect of querying a database, and other, more complex queries are simply extensions of them.
* Starting a new line when using new Statements and Functions to improve **readability**.


### What could be improved
* Knowledge on **JOIN** and **SELF JOIN**
